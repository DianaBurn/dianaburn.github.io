	<p class="first">  1.How long does henna last? </p> 
<p> Henna lasts for 7-10 days; it looks fresh for about a week and fades after that, </p>
<p>depending on how fast your skin is renewing itself and on which part of the body </p>
<p>drawing was made.  Swimming, washing dishes, and doing </p>
<p>housework can accelerate the fading process.</p>

<p class="first"> 2.How is henna applied? </p>
<p>Henna is applied to clean, dry skin. Usually it takes form 30 to 60 minutes for me to </p>
<p>draw mehndi, depending on the complexity of the design. </p>
<p>Once it dry, mix of lemon juice and sugar will be applied for the better stain.</p>
<p>Henna paste is left on for a minimum of 3-4 hours, </p>
<p>though overnight is traditional and guarantees the best color.</p>
<p>After 3-4 hours, the paste is gently removed by picking it off or removing the medical tape.</p> 
<p>Do not wash it off!  The color of mehndi will be orange after removing the paste. </p>
<p>On the next day the color will become darker.</p>
<p>Applying a natural vegetable or beeswax based oil/balm before </p>
<p>bathing can help prolong the life of your henna design.</p>

<p class="first">3.How much it will cost? </p>
<p>It will cost as much as you wish and as much as it worth from your point of view. </p>
<p>Mehndi is the art that I love and that became the part of me. </p>
<p>Sometimes it is just confusing for me to set the price for what I </p>
<p>am simply enjoy doing.  That's why I decided to draw mehndi for </p>
<p>the Donation.  If any of you got interested, feel free to contact me! </p>
